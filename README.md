# Bachelor degree project in Machine Learning
Reinforcement learning has recently become a
promising area of machine learning with significant achievements
in the subject. Recent successes include surpassing human experts
on Atari games and also AlphaGo becoming the first computer
ranked on the highest professional level in the game Go, to
mention a few.
This project aims to apply Policy Gradient Methods (PGM) in
a multi agent environment. PGM are widely regarded as being
applicable to more problems than for instance Deep Q-Learning
but have a tendency to converge upon local optimums. In this
report we aim to explore if an optimal policy is achievable with
PGM in a multi-agent framework.
Numerical simulations implementing the aforementioned
method in an environment with up to 4 agents and moving obstacles showed a convergence and the efficiency of the approach.
A relatively small amount of collisions took place once the learnt
agents were tested. These result differed when changing some
parameters such as learning rates and number of neurons in the
neural network.
The conclusion was that a very fast convergence upon at least
a local optimal policy was achieved in this setting.
